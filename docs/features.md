Aidly leverages the **Solana blockchain** to ensure that all donations are transparent, traceable, and immutable. Fundraising campaigns are managed on-chain, guaranteeing no tampering or censorship of funds.

### 2. **Civic & Phantom Wallet Integration**

To enhance security and trust, Aidly integrates **Civic Auth** and **Phantom Wallet**. This allows users to authenticate with their existing Solana wallets and Civic profiles, ensuring safe identity verification and secure transactions.

### 3. **NFT Rewards & Badges**

Aidly introduces a gamified donation experience by rewarding donors with **NFTs** and **badges**. These serve as tokens of appreciation for contributing to campaigns and can be used as proof of participation in the Aidly ecosystem.

### 4. **100% On-chain Donations**

All donations made on Aidly are 100% on-chain, meaning they are publicly visible and immutable. This transparency promotes trust among donors and helps ensure that funds go directly to the intended cause.

### 5. **Fast Backend (Go + Fiber & Node.js for Web3)**

Aidly is powered by a lightning-fast backend built with **Go** and the **Fiber** web framework for the core API, ensuring low-latency and efficient request handling for a seamless user experience. Additionally, Aidly features a **Web3 backend** built with **Node.js**, responsible for handling all blockchain-related interactions, such as managing Solana transactions and wallet connections.
